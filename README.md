# Projematic-FE

This project was created as a demonstration of the front-end for a project-management website application, according to the specifications of a client.

The main user interface is a fully-responsive project-management flowchart, coded using HTML, SVG graphics, CSS and JavaScript.

Clicking on a flowchart shape shows a popup with more information on the task and displays links to template files which can be used to assist in carrying it out.

In a true version of the application, access to these templates would depend on the user having a subscription to the service and, otherwise, they would be directed to information on subscribing.

In this demonstration version, only four of the shapes have active popups:
* Stakeholder Management Plan
* Stakeholder Register
* Communicate with Stakeholders
* Project Status Report

Furthermore, all links direct the user to a mock-up of a subscription information page, which is opened in a separate tab.

## Note

This is my Fork of an original class group project.

I have:
* Improved the popup JavaScript coding and the popup CSS styling.
* Added a fourth popup.
* Added an initial splash-screen with information about the project.

The original group project, MPG-Projematic-FE, was produced
by the MPG Group of developers:
* MartinDavis3
* poupakkg
* gazeez.
